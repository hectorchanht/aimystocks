# Insights & Recommendations Feature

## Overview
Added structured insights and recommendations to the AI analysis results with enhanced UI display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Updates (`/src/app/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
export interface AnalysisResult {
  analysis: string;
  insights?: string[];        // NEW: Array of key insights
  recommendations?: string[]; // NEW: Array of actionable recommendations
  error?: string;
}
```

### 2. AI Service Updates (`/src/app/services/aiService.ts`)

**Updated System Prompt:**
- Now requests structured JSON output with separate fields for analysis, insights, and recommendations
- AI models return data in this format:
```json
{
  "analysis": "Full markdown analysis...",
  "insights": ["Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"],
  "recommendations": ["Recommendation 1", "Recommendation 2", "Recommendation 3"]
}
```

**New Parser Function:**
- `parseAIResponse()` - Extracts JSON from AI responses
- Handles markdown code blocks (```json```)
- Falls back to raw text if JSON parsing fails
- Returns structured `AnalysisResult` object

**Updated Token Limits:**
- Increased from 800 to 1000 tokens for all services to accommodate structured output

### 3. UI Updates (`/src/app/components/AnalysisDisplay.tsx`)

**New Layout:**
- **Main Analysis Card** - Full detailed analysis in bordered card
- **Insights Section** - Blue-themed card with numbered list and lightbulb icon
- **Recommendations Section** - Green-themed card with checkmarks

**Features:**
- Conditional rendering (only shows sections with data)
- Icons for visual hierarchy
- Color-coded sections (blue for insights, green for recommendations)
- Responsive spacing and typography
- Numbered insights with circular badges
- Checkmark bullets for recommendations

### 4. Store Updates (`/src/app/store/atoms.ts`)
- `resultAtom` now persists the full analysis result including insights and recommendations

## Benefits

1. **Structured Data** - Clear separation between analysis, insights, and recommendations
2. **Better UX** - Visual hierarchy makes it easier to scan key points
3. **Actionable** - Recommendations are clearly highlighted
4. **Persistent** - Results saved to localStorage
5. **Fallback** - Gracefully handles non-JSON responses from AI

## Usage

The AI will automatically structure its response. Users will see:
1. Full analysis at the top
2. Key insights in a blue card (if provided)
3. Recommendations in a green card (if provided)

All three sections are optional and only display if the AI provides that data.
